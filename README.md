# Harvard CS50 AI Projects

This repository contains all the projects I completed during **Harvard's CS50 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python** course. The course covers fundamental concepts in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and provides hands-on experience with Python-based AI algorithms and applications.

## Course Overview

The **CS50 AI course** focuses on essential AI topics, such as search algorithms, knowledge representation, logical inference, and machine learning. The projects in this repository demonstrate my understanding of these concepts through practical implementations.

## Projects Included

### 1. Search
- **Folder**: `/Search`
- **Projects**:
  - `Degrees`: Find the shortest path between two actors based on their appearances in movies, using breadth-first search.
  - `Tic-Tac-Toe`: Implement a minimax algorithm to build an AI that can play optimal moves in the Tic-Tac-Toe game.
  
### 2. Knowledge Representation
- **Folder**: `/KnowledgeRepresentation`
- **Projects**:
  - `Knights`: Solve the Knight’s Tour puzzle on a chessboard using backtracking, aiming to visit each square once with a knight’s move.
  - `Minesweeper`: Create an AI to solve the classic Minesweeper game using logical deduction and probability.

### 3. Uncertainty
- **Folder**: `/Uncertainty`
- **Projects**:
  - `PageRank`: Implement the PageRank algorithm to rank web pages based on their importance, similar to Google’s ranking system.
  - `Heredity`: Model genetic inheritance of traits across generations using probability and logic-based reasoning.

### 4. Optimization
- **Folder**: `/Optimization`
- **Projects**:
  - `Crossword`: Build a crossword puzzle solver using constraint satisfaction techniques.


### 5. Machine Learning
- **Folder**: `/MachineLearning`
- **Projects**:
  - `Nim`: Build an AI that plays the Nim game using reinforcement learning to train itself to win.
  - `Shopping`: Use Naive Bayes classification to build a shopping cart recommender system based on user behavior data.

### 6. Neural Networks
- **Folder**: `/NeuralNetworks`
- **Projects**:
  - `Traffic`: Simulate an intersection using reinforcement learning to optimize traffic signal recognition.
  
### 7. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- **Folder**: `/NaturalLanguageProcessing(NLP)`
- **Projects**:
  - `Parser`: Build a natural language parser using context-free grammar (CFG) that can analyze and structure sentences, identifying parts of speech and syntactic roles.
  - `Attention`: Implement an attention mechanism in neural networks to improve the performance of machine translation by focusing on relevant parts of the input sequence. Thus, guessing the masked words in a sentence.

## How to Use

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project folder that interests you.
3. Follow the instructions provided in the project’s `README.md` or run the Python scripts directly.

## Installation

Some projects may have dependencies. You can install the required Python libraries by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
